										<h2 id="content">Current + Future Goals ü™ê</h2>
										<p>From a young age, I knew I wanted to be involved with technology. Whether it was from my imagination to the idea of being a secret agent, I loved being able to apply my creativity with no limits.
										Superheros, Life-Saving Robots, and Science Fiction seemed to fuel my drive to bring my own ideas to real life. With my introduction to STEM, I begun with hardware with robotics and soldering boards,
										which eventually made me more curious about the software side of things.
										</p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3></h3>
												<p>As I built my own projects and learned how computer science promotes versatility, I was confident in my decision to approach this field through an interdisciplinary approach by applying programming and these technical principles to different fields.
												To achieve this, I want to be able to gain the neccesary experience to impact different communities and consumers through my technical and problem solving skills. This goal will allow me to learn from new people and explore the world while being able to potentially change someone's life as well.
												During my early career, I also want to be able to build my own inventions with hardware and software, seeing how I could balance reason with unconventional approaches when
													developing my own solutions. </p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3></h3>
												<p> Moreover, I would like to not only impact different fields with computer science applications, but also being able to
												show that different paths in technology can be exciting. I have been inspired by women who were able to do the same, being able to seek out all their passions and 
												make a name for themselves in many fields that they have accomplished. At the end of the day, I want to continue to value my curiosity and develop my career in technology by adding to this dynamic field.</p>
